# 🚀 Next.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Next.js Learning Repository** — a collection of concepts, examples, and mini snippets that I’ve explored while mastering the **App Router** and the fundamentals of **modern Next.js development**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧭 App Router

Learned how the **App Router** simplifies routing and file structure with the `app/` directory — enabling nested layouts, server components, and dynamic routes.

### ⚛️ React Client & Server Components 

Explored the difference between **Client** and **Server Components** in Next.js:

- Server Components handle data fetching and rendering on the server.
- Client Components use `"use client"` for interactivity and state management.

### 🛣️ Routing 

Understood file-based routing, dynamic routes (`[id]`), and nested layouts using the new app router.

### 🌐 Data Fetching 

Learned various **data fetching** techniques like:

- `fetch()` in Server Components
- Static Rendering (`export const revalidate`)
- Dynamic Rendering and Caching

### ⚙️ API Routes 

Built and handled backend logic using **API Routes** inside the `app/api/` directory.

### 💾 Caching

Explored **Next.js caching strategies** for server-side performance, including `force-cache`, `no-store`, and incremental static regeneration (ISR).

### 🔌 Build Adapters API 

Learned how **Build Adapters** work to deploy Next.js apps seamlessly on different platforms.

### 🪪 Metadata 

Worked with the new **Metadata API** to set dynamic titles, descriptions, and social previews for pages.
